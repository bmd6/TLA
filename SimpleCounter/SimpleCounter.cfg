\* Configuration file for SimpleCounter.tla

\* Specify which TLA+ specification formula should be checked.
\* We use the 'Spec' definition from the .tla file.
SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Define the values for the constants declared in the .tla file.
CONSTANT Procs = {p1, p2}   \* Let's have two processes, named p1 and p2.
                            \* Assigns a concrete value to the Procs constant. Here, we define it as a set
                            \*  containing two elements p1 and p2 (these are just uninterpreted model values,
                            \*  essentially names).

\* Specify which properties (invariants) TLC should check.
\* TLC will verify if 'TypeOK' holds true in all reachable states.
INVARIANT TypeOK            \* Tells TLC to check if the TypeOK predicate (defined in SimpleCounter.tla) holds true
                            \* in every reachable state, starting from Init and following the Next relation.

\* Optional: Specify constraints if the state space is too large.
\*  though not needed for this simple example.
\* CONSTANT constraint_name == counter < 10
